+Create a <Client>.statistics that is changeable at any time.
+    When changed, store and wait for Client to request changes
+When Client requests statistics (by sending client status with actionId=1)
+    Convert statistic names
+    Convert statistic units (ie blocks to cm and seconds to ticks)

+    Send only statistics that have changed
+Implement changeEvent for statistics
+Create a statisticsOpened event (or something similarly named) that fires when Client requests statistics

+Test custom damage statistics
+Fix data (because the order is currently incorrect)
Test all statistic types and units
