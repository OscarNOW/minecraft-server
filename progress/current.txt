client status actionId=1
statistics

Create a <Client>.statistics that is changeable at any time.
When Client requests statistics (by sending client status with actionId=1)
    Convert statistic names
    Convert statistic units (ie blocks to cm and seconds to ticks)

    send all statistics first time
    send changes with previous all other times
Test if we can just send changed statistics anytime, instead of waiting for Client to request them
Create a statisticsOpened event (or something similarly named) that fires when Client requests statistics
